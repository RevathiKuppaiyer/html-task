    <pre>
   An 18-metre high monolithic statue of Lord Buddha towers over the lake from atop the Rock of Gibraltar. The idea was a part of the Buddha Poornima project in 1985 by N. T. Rama Rao. 
The statue was chiselled out of a white granite rock, weighing 450 tons. It was carved by 200 sculptors for two years. The statue was transported to Hyderabad in November 1988. 
After initial problems, the statue was erected on 12 April 1992 on a red lotus pedestal.
